        <!-- HISTORY -->
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">DISSECTION PUZZLE</h2>
            In a dissection puzzle, a polygon is required to be cut into the minimal number of pieces that can then be reassembled into another polygon. The history of dissection puzzles dates back to Plato's era (427â€“347 BCE) in ancient Greece.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_puzzle"> [Wikipedia] </a><br><br>

            An example of a dissection puzzle is the square trisection, which involves dividing a large square into the fewest polygons possible to create three smaller, identical squares. Historical records trace the first 9-piece solution to around 1000 AD. This was followed by an 8-piece solution circa 1400 AD, a 7-piece solution in 1877, and a groundbreaking 6-piece solution in 1891.

            Dissecting a regular polygons into other regular polygons has been well-studied field. The best-known dissections have been documented and stored.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The mitre puzzle</h3>

            Dissection puzzles gained popularity in the late 19th century when newspapers and magazines began to feature them. Famous puzzle creators Sam Loyd (US) and Henry Dudeney (UK) frequently included these puzzles into their columns.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_puzzle">[Wikipedia] </a><br><br>

            The early version of the mitre puzzle, dating back to the early 19th century, presents the challenge of cutting a mitre shape into four parts of same size and shape. That is actually impossible with exact measures and interconnected pieces. The intended solution utilized corner-connected pieces.
            <a href="https://archive.org/details/puzzlesoldnew00hoff/page/346"> [Hoffman, 1893] </a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/AmusementsInMathematicsDudeneyHenry/page/n333"> [Dudeney, 1917] </a><br><br>

            In 1901, Sam Loyd introduced a variation of the mitre puzzle, asking solver to divide the mitre shape into fewest pieces possible which will fit together and form a square. He also revealed his 4-piece solution.
            [Loyd, 1901a] [Loyd, 1901b]<br><br>

            However, in 1911, Henry Dudeney demonstrated that Loyd's solution was faulty and then presented his own 5-piece solution.
            <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheStrandMagazineVolume41/page/746">            [Dudeney, 1911a] </a>

            The quest for a 4-piece solution has continued until recently (May 2024). This solution has one piece (green) that is flipped over, leaving room for further improvement.<br>

        <!-- SOFTWARE -->
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">SOFTWARE</h2>
            An optimizer software was developed to solve dissection puzzles:<br>

            <ol>
                <li>The software receives a dissection puzzle as input, consisting of two polygons (provided as lists of vertex points) and the number of allowed cuts.</li><br>
                <li>It begins by randomizing the initial cuts and dissection fitness value is calculated comparing polygons between two dissections using turning function values.</li><br>
                <li>Next, the software optimizes the dissection fitness by making incremental adjustments to the cut lines. This process employs simulated annealing to progressively refine the cuts. If the fitness value becomes sufficiently small, the dissection is considered a potential solution.</li>
            </ol>

            All calculations are performed numerically and must be verified manually. Currently, verification is done using geometric constraint-solving software, such as the sketch tool in a CAD program. There is a small chance that some solutions may not be mathematically accurate, even though they are numerically very close.<br><br>

            At present, the software cannot handle curved lines. Incorporating curved lines could potentially lead to numerous new 5-piece (or even 4-piece) solutions. Another interesting area of exploration is using fractal cutting lines.<br><br>


        <!-- 5-PIECE SOLUTIONS -->
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">5-PIECE SOLUTIONS</h2>
            Since Dudeney's revelation, several individuals have found new 5-piece solutions.
            <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Kb_oBJUdloy09loHT3cdqQ"> [Wei] </a><br><br>

            The software was developed to find more, and the findings are listed in the image below. In fact, there are infinitely many 5-piece solutions to the mitre puzzle, as cutting lines in some solutions can be smoothly shifted to generate numerous new dissections.<br><br>
